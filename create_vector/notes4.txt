The last line will not compile as is since it is not proper constructor or 
assignment syntax. I think what this line of code is doing is it's declaring
a vector of ints, but is then attempting to intitialize the vector as ints (rather
than assigning ints to elements within the vector).

To make this code run properly, it would depend on what you were looking to do. Quick
fixes would be to either change the parentheses to curly braces if you'd like to initialize
the vector with some values, or you could remove the equal sign and leave it as
a constructor that would create a vector with 10 elements each assigned the value 5.
