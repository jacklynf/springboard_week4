The load factor increases until the size of the unordered map is equal to the number of buckets. 
After this, we see the load factor decrease and then begin increasing agian. This is because the 
load factor is the ratio of nodes per bin, and as more nodes are added, the ratio goes up. Then,
when more bins need to be added, the keys are rehashed, the container is made larger, and the keys
are reassigned to new bins. When this happens, we now have (I think) double the bins, which is
why we see the load_factor values drop before climbing again.
