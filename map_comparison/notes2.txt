The difference in ordering suggests that the underlying data structures
are quite different. As we discussed last week, the unordered map uses a
hash function to assign a node to a bin. This is why the ordering appears
random. The ordered map instead compares values as they're inserted. 
cppreference.com shows the difference between unordered map and ordered
map. You can see that the definition of ordered map includes a Compare
class to determine the key sorting, whereas the unordered map uses a
Hash class.
